(to delete) Concise explanation of the idea (ideally include a rough sketch). Hint: you can add images to this doc!

The user will be able to give a mood and an amount of time they wish to listen. Then the program will generate a playlist based on that mood and the length of time so that the user will be able to listen to all the songs chosen during their session.
